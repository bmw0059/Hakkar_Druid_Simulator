Calculates the odds of winning with the Hakkar druid combo in Hearthstone given different parameters such as:
- Number of corrupted bloods in the deck
- Number of other cards in the deck
- Amount of HP of the opponent
- Current fatigue damage
- Number of naturalizes used (or total draws)

This simulator was used to test specific complex scenarios encountered at a high legend rank.
A winrate of 60% (157W - 105L) was achieved, and this deck was piloted (alongside Secret Odd Mage) to Rank #1 Legend in NA.
